## Setup
Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/Raccoons-Rise-Up/server-cpp.git`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

For Windows generate Visual Studio 2019 project files by running `scripts/vs2019.cmd`.
